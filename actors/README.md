# Welcome to ActorDB

ActorDB is your home for keeping track of the actors you love. When you consume as much cinema as you do, it can be difficult to remember names and where you saw this person before. With ActorDB, you can simply add the actor to your personal database with biographical information and the movies in which you've seen them! Now the next time you're taking in a film and you see a familiar face, you can fire up ActorDB and scroll through your collected thespians.

A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
Have links to your hosted and working apps in the README.md files in your GitHub repos.

## Technologies Used

The backend of this app is built with a Django framework using Python. It is deployed via Heroku and accessible by other sites. The frontend is built using react.

## Approach Taken
The idea was born of a mutual appreciate for Nicolas Cage's body of work and mastery of his art. We felt that building a crud app around actors would provide a benefit for any cinema lover in the same way Letterboxd provides a space for voices.

In order to avoid merge conflicts, the repos were created by one developer and the components were factored by individual developers before being added to the App.js file.

## Unsolved Problems


## Future Goals
User authentication, using IMdb API for cross referencing films/adding directly to user db
